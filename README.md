The target of the charopt project is to generate scripts for various RPG Systems to create a semi optimised character given the personal choices of the player.

As of now it only supports a limited range of classes and playstyles, if you find yourself with experience playing a playstyle that not yet exists or disagree with the way prioritisation works please contact me.

Bear in mind that any stats output are designed for general usefulness and that they will frequently requre changing to suit your characters needs.

For a detailed list of races see --races. Similarly for a full list of supported Classes see --classes.
