The target of charopt is to create a tool to give a roughly optimised Attributedistribution for (for now) DnD 5e Characters.

Right now it is limited to my own theorising and experience only, if you find yourself with experience playing a playstyle that not yet exists or disagree with the way prioritisation works please contact me.

Bear in mind that any stats output are designed for general usefulness and that they will frequently require changing to suit your characters needs.

For a detailed list of races see --races. Similarly for a full list of supported Classes see --classes.

Installation Instructions:
Make sure you have golang installed (https://golang.org/)
then navigate to the folder and either go build ./5eoptimiser.go or go run ./5eoptimiser.go
