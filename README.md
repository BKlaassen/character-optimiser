The target of charopt is to create a tool to give a roughly optimised Attributedistribution for (for now) DnD 5e Characters.

Right now it is limited to my own theorising and experience only, if you find yourself with experience playing a playstyle that not yet exists or disagree with the way prioritisation works please contact me.

Bear in mind that any stats output are designed for general usefulness and that they will frequently require changing to suit your characters needs.

The script requires you to have a go compiler (https://golang.org/dl/) and either `go build 5eoptimiser.go` and executing the resulting file or `go run 5eoptimiser.go`

For a detailed list of races see --races. Similarly for a full list of supported Classes see --classes.
